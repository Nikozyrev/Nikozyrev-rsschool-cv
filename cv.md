# Nikita Kozyrev
## Front-end software developer
### About me and my work
I was a financial manager in the IT sphere in the past. At this work I created a lot of tables and charts that represented the situation and dynamics of all business aspects.
What I liked in the process the most is coding. So I decided to go forward and become a software developer. I chose Frontend (JavaScript) and I'm actively moving in this direction now.
But also I learned Python previously and created some projects that I used in my work.
