## Financial Manager
### About me and my work
I'm a financial manager in the IT sphere. The main my passion in my work is building tables and charts that can represent the situation and dynamics of all business aspects.  And the main reward is the best decisions that management can take based on my work.

And what I like in the process the most is coding. So I decided to go forward and become a software developer. I chose Frontend (JavaScript) and I'm actively moving in this direction now. But also I learned Python previously and prepared some projects that I used in my work (see code examples below).
